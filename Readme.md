Perl implementation of the Schematron.

XML::Schematron::XPath serves as a simple validator for XML based on Rick JELLIFFE's Schematron XSLT script. 
A Schematron schema defines a set of rules in the XPath language that are used to examine the contents of an XML document tree.

For usage details, have a look at the module's documentation: https://metacpan.org/pod/XML::Schematron
